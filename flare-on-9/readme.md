## Mandiant Flare-On 9 Write-ups

My write-ups for a couple of challenges from Flare-On 9 (2022) that I enjoyed the
most.

The write-ups tend to follow my route through the challenges, but I do take the
odd detour to point out alternative methods or interesting tricks. I am including
the code for all the tools I 'developed' to solve the challenges. Although
some of these tools will generalize, they are far from being production-grade code.

As usual I recommend that you get the challenge binaries and follow my footsteps
in IDA or other tool of your choice.

Enjoy the journey,
